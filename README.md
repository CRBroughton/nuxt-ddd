# 🙋🏽‍♂️ Domain Driven Design & Nuxt - Using Nuxt Modules to structure large Nuxt Apps

#### ⚡️ Talk at NUXT NATION 2021 by Anton Reindl

In this talk I will introduce Domain Driven Design and talk about structuring apps according to domain modules, and demonstrate how to use Nuxt modules to create independent submodules including Vuex modules and routes.

## 👨🏼‍💻 Demo
1. This Nuxt.js-app is a barebone create-nuxt-app installation 
2. As a showcase example, the app adds two modules: a blog module and a shop module 
3. The modules are implemented as a [Nuxt Module](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/modules#write-your-own-module) with their individual routing, store, etc.

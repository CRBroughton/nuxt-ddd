# üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Domain-Driven Design & Nuxt - Using Nuxt Modules to structure large Nuxt Apps

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Talk at NUXT NATION by Anton Reindl

In my talk in 2021, I introduced Domain Driven Design and talked about structuring apps according to domain modules. I and demonstrated how to use Nuxt 2 modules to create independent submodules including Vuex modules and routes.

The original Nuxt 2 example can be found in a legacy [here](https://github.com/areindl/nuxt-structure-with-modules/tree/nuxt-v2).

### üöÄ Nuxt 3

I reimplemented the example of "Anton's Biketours" in Nuxt 3.  This example implements a fresh Nuxt 3 with an landing page ( `pages/index.vue` ) and one domain-module module, namely the blog-module imported from `.modules/blog` . The module has its own components, composable and pages folder to better separate the domain from the rest of the app.

I also recommend to look at the [documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org).

## Scope

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/deployment).
